# How-Do-I.IO

A search page for the three main methods of learning. Users can enter a search term they wish to learn and recieve results including videos, groups, and books to learn from.

## Inspiration

I found myself searching Google for book recommendations, then searching for events for like-minded people and watching videos online that were related to whatever it was I was learning. Shouldn't there be a site for this?
