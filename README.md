# How-Do-I.IO

A search page for the three main methods of learning. Users can enter a search term they wish to learn and recieve results including videos, groups, and books to learn from.

## Inspiration

I found myself searching the internet for book recommendations, how-to videos online or for events with like-minded people that I could potentially learn from all the time. Through hopping back and forth between different sites and searches, I decided building one site with one search could really help.
